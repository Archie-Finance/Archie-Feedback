# Archie-Feedback
The place to add Archie feedback

### Goal
This repository should be used to aggregate marketing or product feedback describing a pain, problem, or proposed enhancement. We strongly encourage describing the use case and business impact, as well as possible solutions if applicable.

### How Should I submit a ticket?
Via Issues. Create an issue, choose one of the templates, fill out the title and description, and submit the new issue

### What's the process from there?
All issues will be triaged and prioritized. Conversations will live within the issue comments if additional context is needed or if there are updates to the issue.
